      <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>Gravitude Limited Liability Co. was founded on the idea that new perspectives change lives. 
         Any activity that can introduce a new perspective has immense value in our world.  Gravitude 
        was founded in 2021 by Lee Westropp and his father Geoff, who share passions in both aviation 
        and adventure sports.  Gravitude owns two child companies - AI Scuba Dive and flyGravitude - 
        which teach adventure seekers to keep an attitude of gratitude as they push the limits of gravity.</p>

      <p>Meet Lee!<br>Lee lives for the outdoors. He spends his free time surfing, snowboarding, backpacking, and camping.  
      The rest of his time is split between teaching divers and pilots.  His two shops, in Compton and 
      Hawthorne are where he spends most of his work hours.  When he's not in his shops he's at the beach, 
      hanging out at an airport, or working on his always broken down cars.  He holds certifications as 
      a PADI Master Scuba Diver Trainer, EFR Instructor, WMA Wilderness First Responder, AAA Avalanche 
      Professional I, Commercial Pilot - Rotorcraft, Certified Flight Instructor - ASEL, and Certified
